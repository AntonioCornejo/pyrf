===========

Blocking Sockets
----------------

This library will continue to be usable in a simple
blocking-socket manner the way the simple examples do.

Simple data capture and processing needs can be accomplished
with few lines of code.

Twisted and Async
-----------------

The device API has being extended so that it can also work with a
provided non-blocking `Twisted <http://twistedmatrix.com/>`_ API,
or any other async library the user chooses to add support for.
